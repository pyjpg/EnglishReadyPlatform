2,"Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Poverty represents a worldwide crisis. It is the ugliest epidemic in a region, which could infect countries in the most debilitating ways. To tackle this issue, rich countries need to help those in need and give a hand when possible. I agree that there are several ways of aiding poor countries other than financial aid, like providing countries in need with engineers, workers, and soldiers who would build infrastructure. Building universities, hospitals, and roadways. By having a solid infrastructure, poor countries would be able to monetise their profits and build a stronger and more profitable economy which would help them in the long term. Once unprivilged countries find their niche, the major hurdle would be passed and would definitely pave the way for much brighter future. However, I do disagree that financial aid does not solve poverty, it does if used properly and efficiently. The most determining factor if financial aid would be the way to go, is by identifying what type of poor countries' representative are dealing with. Some countries will have a responsible leader and some will not, with that being said, implementing a strategy, to distinguish responsible leaders from others, would tailor the type of aid rich countries could use. An example, A clear report and constant observation would be applied to track the progress and how this type of aid is being monetized. In summary, types of aid varies from country to another, and tailoring the type of aid is of paramount importance to solve this problem that had huge toll on poor countries.",,,,,,6.5

In 1995, half of the people born in australia are from cities, 30% from rural areas and only 20% are from towns. For the people outside of Australia, most of the people still born in cities, which is around 60%. but the number of rural areas increased to 40% with the towns born rate decreased to only 10%.
In 2010, The people born in cities increased significianly in both in and outside Australia, especially in outside Australia, which reached 80%. The people bore in towns decreased simutanuously, to around 17% of the people born in Australia and 10% of outside Australia respectively. The most significiant change happened at rual areas numbers. It has shrinked to 17% of people born in Australia, and only around 5% of peopel bore outside Australia.

2,"Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Human beings are facing many challenges nowadays. Poverty is always an critical topic among countries, especially the poverty in developing countries. Developed countries frequently offer financial support to poor countries but the poverty still exist. Experts are arguing that developed countries should consider other solutions to help solve the poverty issue. I believe this is a much better direction compare to money support only.
Money is essential to many factors like food, contruction and hospital. With money provided by developed countries, govenment can improve the inforstructure, supporting poor family with food, building more houses for the poor people, builing more schools to support children's education, which is critical for people to get out of poverty.
But money cannot solve everything. The poverty caused by many reasons like lacking of resource and experienced governor. None of them could be solved by simply offering money to the goverment. Besides, money could cause a bad habit to the governor, they may reply on the financial support too much. If the financial support ended someday, which could happen anytime in the current circurmestance, it will cause big trouble again.
Devevloped countries should focus on a sophicated solution instead of just providing money. For example, they can help poor countries to build manufacturing industry, and give certain subsides for the customer who buy directly from them. Developed countries also can send experienced instructor to help governer in poor countries build a better government system to improve the efficiency of governance, authority of justice, to make sure company feel safe to invest in these developing counties, which could have a long term benifit for the people there.
Overall, I am agree that money could help to solve the poverty but without other support from different functions, it may not the best solution for poverty.",,,,,,5.5
1,"The graph below shows the number of overseas visitors to three different areas in a European country between 1987 and 2007Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.","Information about the thousands of visits from overseas to three different European natural places during 1987 and 2007 is provided in the given line chart.
Overall, it can be seen that the number of visitors increased significantly in the three places compared to the initial year. Although, visits to Europeans lakes demostrated more changes over the 20 years than its counterparts.
In more detail, the most steady growth was experienced by the visits to Europeans mountains. For example, from 1987 the number of visitors grew from 20,000 to almost the double 20 years later. Similarly, visits to the coast also rose after a slight fall in 1992, reaching almost twice as much since 1987, with 75,000.
Those visiting Europeans lakes subtantially increased over the years from 10 thousand to a peak of 75 thousand in 2002. Despite falling for about 25 thousand in 2007, the visitis to this place remained higher compared to 1987, with 50,000 at the end of the period.",,,,,,7
2,"Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Whether countries should only invest facilities and training on their elite athletes in order to win international competitions or give the same opportunities for all remains a big discussion. In this essay I will explain both views and why I think participation for all is the way which brings positive consequences.
Those supporting the first view believe that the odds to win are only high if the countries invest specialised facilities on their top sportmen. This is because, only athletes trained to reach the highest performance guarantee high scores. For example, it is known that China sends only its elite sportmen to compete in the Olympics and statistically, they usually win numbers of medals.
On the other hand, those who support sports facilities and training for all athletes consider that non-top ones can also have great opportunities to succeed. For instance, Diego Maradona, a Argentinian soccer player, never played in a professional field, on the contrary, he was discovered playing in an old field located in a poor village. This means that by providing facilities for all, gifted sportmen might be discovered and they can make history too.
In my opinion, as a supporter of the second view, I believe that permiting everyone to train and use sports facilities is the best way to achieve international sports. For me, winning is as essential as participation. Besides, this way leads to find natural talents among the local population, which is inspiring for others in similar circunstances.
In conclusion, although the two positions have strong arguments. I think that the one supporting facilities for all people is the one that can bring positive developments to achieve sports events. Participation and inclusiveness may help to find gifted athletes among ordinary people.",,,,,,6.5
1,"The graph below shows the number of overseas visitors to three different areas in a European country between 1987 and 2007Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.","This graph depicts the changes in tourists visits between 1987 and 2007 to these three places in Europe. It's clear from the graph, that generally the coast area have the highest number of visitors all over the years.
According to what is shown in the linear figure in 1987 period visitors first place was the coast with 40 visitor and in seconed place was the mountains with half number of coast's visitors and the lakes became lastly.
While the statistics have been changed at 2002 , the lakes sharply increased to be the first place by reaching the highest number of it's visitors, and the coast is the seconed.
Finally at 2007 , the coast speedly increased to be most place having tourists and the lakes dramaticlly declined to take the seconed place. The rules switched between coast and lakes numbers.
To sum up , the linear graph describe a constantly change in mountains visitors numbers , and sharply changes in coast and lakes visitors numbers.",,,,,,6.5
2,"Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Sports is an essential part to most of us , some of us consider it a lifestyle and others consider it a job or source of income , So it's a huge part in our live.
Building specialized facilities to improve and develop athelets levels it's kind of encouragment to this category of people , and it reflects enormous benefit to them. Either by providing to them the professional training or by make them ready to international competitions. But narrowing the attention of sports to a specific category and ignore other categories actually doesn't sounds a good idea.
Athelets consider as a important part of the community but the don't cover most of it, and other people have the right to have sport facilities that suits their level and everyone whatever is it beginner or professional can use it.
Sports is a public interest that doesn't include specific people in it, and it's important to all genders and all ages, so providing facilities to specific ones can end up with unfairness results. In other hand , providing this facilities to all public people will lead to increase in sport awarness and end up with more people having healthy lifesyle.
In conclousion , according to medical facts said that's doing sport daily and make it essence in your life decreases heart attacks and raise the life quality, specified just the athelets people with sports facilities is undesireable decision. In other hand , raising the number of gyms and sports areas will conclude with healthier society.",,,,,,5.5
1,"The graph below shows the number of overseas visitors to three different areas in a European country between 1987 and 2007Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.","The line graph illustrates the number of overseas tourists to three different areas in a European country (coast, mountains, lakes) from 1987 to 2007
Overall, it can be seen that the number of visitors has increased for the three categories of areas over the period given. Furthermore, in 2007 the highest number of visitors was reported on the coast at approximately 85 thousand. The second most popular areas were the lakes and last were the mountains.
In regard to the coast, we can see that the number of visitors from 1987 to 1992 decreased. However, from 1992 to 2007 there was a consistently increased number of tourists climbing to over 70 thousand visitors in the final year of analysis.
About the mountains, the number of overseas tourists begat at 20 thousand and has increased to reach over 30 thousand by 2007.
Finally, the lakes were visited by 10 thousand tourists in 1987 and rose significantly to reach over 70 thousand in 2002 and then decreased to 50 thousand by 2007.",,,,,,8
2,"Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.","International sports events require the most well-trained athletes for each country, in order to achieve this goal countries make an effort to build infrastructure designed to train top athletes. Although this policy can indeed make fewer sports facilities for ordinary people, investing in the best athletes is vital to develop competitive sports performances in each country.
On the one hand, building specific infrastructure for the best athletes is crucial in order to get better results at international sports events such as The Olympics or the World Cup. The importance of getting better results is that it creates awareness of the importance of sports in society and motivates more people to do a sport. In this way, investing in these developments can help countries to develop an integral sport policy that can benefit everyone.
On the other hand, one can argue that a negative effect could be that less infrastructure is built for the rest of the people. However, people who practice a sport in their daily life do not necessarily need some facilities to do sports. For example, people often use public spaces to do sports such as running or doing yoga at the nearest park to their home. So, for people who is not top athletes there could be some alternatives for sports facility that ,is not the case for training top athletes.
To sum up, I strongly believe countries should invest in specialised infrastructure for their best athletes because in the long term is going to generate more motivation to do sports, to invest in sports at schools and therefore to build more sports infrastructure for everyone.",,,,,,9
1,"The graph below shows the number of overseas visitors to three different areas in a European country between 1987 and 2007Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.","The graph provides information about the number of overseas visitors to three areas in a European country namely; the coast, the mountains and the lakes. The data compare figures recorded in 1987 until 2007.
Overall, the coast had the greatest number of visitors in the first year and will continue until the end of the study. Meanwhile, among the three locations, mountains were noted to be the least among the categories.
In detail, at the start of the year, the coast was noted to be the highest with 40 thousand visitors in 1987. In the succeeding year, it had slightly decreased to 35 thousand. However, it had a sharp increased in number in follwing years and reached almost 80 thousand visitors at 2007
The lakes were observed to be in lowest number of tourists who visited the location, at a number of 10 thousand in 1987, and this was followed by people who went to the mountains with 20 thousand visitors on the same year. However, in 1992 the two locations had identical pattern which rose up to over 20 thousand visitors respectively. The mountains had a slightly contuinuous increasing pattern throughout the remaining years ending with 35 thousand visitors. Meanwhile, the lakes continuous increased its number until 2002 with over 70 thousand visitors This figures, however, showed a drastically decreasing pattern with 50 thousand visitors at the end of 2007.",,,,,,5.5
2,"Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Athletes to be on the top need to have high-end facilities that a country can provide for them to be able to improve their strengths and skills. Some government opted to build facilities exclusively for training athletes for international sports goals, instead of building establishments for everyone to have the liberty of using the sports facilities. From my perspective, this phenomena is a negative development.
Being able to discover an individual's potential, they need to have a support from any form of sources. Establishing sports facilities can help people to discover their own interests, talents and even skills in learning new things. Centers which offer utilities, equipments and state-of-the-art tools that provide learning sports can be a great advantage to people who want to train themselves on the things that can awaken their interests when it comes to sports.
In addition, building these kind of establishments, not only for the purpose to train top athletes, but also for people to immerse themselves to different variaties of activities can help them socialize more with their peers. This is extremely beneficial that aside from doing sports that they are into, they get to play along with peers, discover one's potential and also learning from one another. Furthermore, these individuals can also have the future to be one of top athletes that a country can have.
In conclusion, although there are countries that chose to have their sports establishments exclusively for training top athletes, I assert that these that actions can be lead to negative feedbacks. Government should allow everyone the privilege to use and avail facilities that can hone an individual's talents, skills and dexterity when it comes to sports and this can also be immensely benefical for both country and citizen alike.",,,,,,5.5
1,"The graph below shows the number of overseas visitors to three different areas in a European country between 1987 and 2007Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.","The graph bellow illustrates the amount of travellers who travelled between 1987 to 2007 to three different locations (the coast, the mountains, the lakes) in a particular European country, we can see that over all the coast and the lakes had more visitors than the mountains.
The number of the coast visitors reached 40 thousands in 1987 then it declined to its lowest in 1992 by almost 35 thousand visitors and then it went up gradually to 75 thousand travelers in 2007.
While the lake visitors started from 10 thousand in 1987 and continued rising until it reached its peak in 2002 by over 70 thousand travelers, then it witnessed a severe fall and went down to 50 thousand visitors by the year 2007.
unlike the lake and the coast which had their ups and downs the mountain areas had a slowly steady raise of number of visitors which started by 20 thousand visitor in 1987 and reached to almost 35 thousand visitors in 2007.",,,,,,6.5
2,"Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is often argued that some countries invist in devolping highly specialised training centers to train its top athletes to achieve international sports, instead of facilitate and provide public training centers for everyone to use and to practice. In my opinion i think both ideas together can contribue a very successful achievement in international sports for the country.
Building highly specialised facilities by the country to train its top athletes can help the athletes to get an apropriate training, give them the chance to progress faster and to be qualified to win or host international compititions like olympics, for example if the country invists and build a large swimming center to train professional swimmers, it is highly likely for them to win and get medals in international compititions.
On the other side providing various sport centers for the public use will encourage people to train and practice all kinds of sports more which leads to gaining more athletes to represent the country, for example allowing and giving access to a young talented girls to practice their favorite sport like football, ice skating, bascketball and more will give them the apportinety to become a professional athletes who would benifit and represent the country.
In conclusion, i think both invisting in building specialised facilities to train the top athletes to win and host an international compititions, and invisting in providing sport centers for everyone to use to encourage and build more athletes could be benificial and counribue a highly international achievement in sports for the country it self.",,,,,,6
