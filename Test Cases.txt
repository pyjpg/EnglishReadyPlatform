The table presents data on the number of people from five different nationalities living in each other's countries across Europe. The nationalities included are British, German, Italian, Polish, and Spanish, with figures shown for where each group resides.

Overall, it is clear that Spain and Germany host the largest numbers of foreign residents among the five nationalities, while Poland has the lowest figures in both hosting and sending populations. Spanish nationals living abroad represent the largest group, particularly in Italy and Germany.

In terms of absolute numbers, the Spanish population living in Italy is the highest, with approximately 550,000 people, followed by the 426,000 Italians residing in Germany. Spain also has a significant number of British (391,000) and German (196,000) residents. By contrast, Poland has relatively low figures in all categories, with the highest number being 100,000 Italians living there, and only 170 Spanish nationals.

Notably, Britain is home to a substantial number of German and Italian nationals — 297,000 and 110,000 respectively — but receives fewer Polish and Spanish immigrants in comparison. Meanwhile, Germany is a major host country, with over a million total foreign residents from the listed nationalities.

Migration has long played a crucial role in shaping cultural identities and economic landscapes across nations. Countries with strong economies often attract individuals seeking better opportunities, while those with limited resources tend to experience emigration. Historical ties, language similarities, and bilateral agreements can also influence migration patterns. In recent decades, the European Union has made cross-border movement easier, enabling citizens to live and work across member states with fewer restrictions. This increased mobility has led to diverse and multicultural communities, especially in urban areas. As societies evolve, so too do the reasons people relocate — from economic necessity to lifestyle preferences or political stability.
